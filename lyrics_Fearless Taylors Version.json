For her first five albums, she left hidden notes via capitalized letters in her album booklets, and she continued this tradition to hide the message \u201cApril Ninth\u201d in the note, revealing the release date.",

I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\"\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you47Embed"

But I never do\nThe way the tires turn stones on old county roads\nThey leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you\nYou find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know\nYou can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be\nBut like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in\nYou can't change where it's been, reminds me of me\n\nI lived and I learned\nHad you, got burned\nHeld out and held on\nGod knows, too long, and wasted time\nLost tears, swore that I'd get out of here\nBut no amount of freedom gets you clean\nI've still got you all over me\n\nThe best and worst day of June\nWas the one that I met you\nWith your hands in your pockets\nAnd your \"Don't you wish you had me?\" grin\nWell I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child\nNow, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then\nYou might also like\nAnd I lived and I learned\nHad you, got burned\nHeld out and held on\nGod knows, too long, and wasted time\nLost tears, swore that I'd get out of here\nBut no amount of freedom gets you clean\nI've still got you all over me\n\n\nI lived and I learned\nAnd found out what it was to turn around\nAnd see that we\nWere never really meant to be\nSo I lied, and I cried\nAnd I watched a part of myself die\n'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean\nI've still got you all over me\n\nI've still got you all over me\nStill got you all over me40Embed"

I don't know what to think\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\"\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you3Embed"
