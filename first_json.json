She followed that with the release of \u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d on May 6, 2022, as part of the soundtrack on Prime Video\u2019s series, The Summer I Turned Pretty, making it officially the second re-recorded track on 1989 to see the light of day.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson posted a snippet of \u201cBad Blood (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d teased in the DC League of Super-Pets film, further hinting at 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019s release. However, the song never came out prior the album\u2019s release.\n\nSwift officially announced the record\u2019s release date on August 9, 2023, during the closing night of the first US leg of her The Eras Tour. In an Instagram post, she also revealed that this was her favorite re-recording and it would have five additional songs, also known as \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks. Additionally, being released on October 27, 2023, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019s release date is exactly nine years after the original version of the album came out in 2014, making it Swift\u2019s first re-recorded album to come out on the exact day and month as its first version.\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Swift collaborated with Google and fans across the globe had to solve different crosswords 33 million times in order to have access to the name of four \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks on 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). Fans were able to solve those crosswords in one day and, on September 20th, the title of those tracks were revealed. However, fans still don\u2019t have access to the title of one song, and, on September 20, 2023, Taylor Nation posted a different crossword for them to try to figure out the title of the last

To New York (Taylor\u2019s Version) Lyrics\nWalkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow\nKaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats\nEverybody here wanted somethin' more\nSearchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before\nAnd it said\n\n\"Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\"\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermor\u0435\nThe lights are so bright, but they n\u0435ver blind me, me\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\n\nWhen we first dropped our bags on apartment floors\nTook our broken hearts, put them in a drawer\nEverybody here was someone else before\nAnd you can want who you want\nBoys and boys and girls and girls\n\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore\nThe lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me\nWelcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nYou might also like\nLike any great love, it keeps you guessing\nLike any real love, it's ever-changing\nLike any true love, it drives you crazy\nBut you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything\n\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nWelcome to New York,

Rumors fly\nAnd I know you heard about me\nSo, hey, let's be friends\nI'm dyin' to see how this one ends\nGrab your passport and my hand\nI can make the bad guys good for a weekend\n\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over, mm\nIf the high was worth th\u0435 pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll t\u0435ll you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless, mm\nOr with a nasty scar\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\nYou might also like\nCherry lips, crystal skies\nI could show you incredible things\nStolen kisses, pretty lies\nYou're the king, baby, I'm your queen\nFind out what you want\nBe that girl for a month\nWait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no\nScreaming, crying, perfect storms\nI can make all the tables turn\nRose garden filled with thorns\nKeep you second guessin', like\n\"Oh, my God, who is she?\"\nI get drunk on jealousy\nBut you'll come back each time you leave\n'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a

other girl\"\nSome other girl\nYou might also like\nHe says, \"What you heard is true, but I\nCan't stop thinkin' 'bout you,\" and I\nI said, \"I've been there too a few times\"\n\n'Cause you got that

Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

control\n\nDidn't they tell us, \"Don\u2019t rush into things\"?\nDidn't you flash your green eyes at me?\nHaven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?\nOoh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?\nI felt your arms twistin' around me\nI should have slept with one eye open at night\n\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it\nAnd we pretended it could last forever, eh\nWe found

our way\nToo in love to think straight\nAll alone or so it seemed\nBut there were strangers watchin'\nAnd whispers turned to talkin'\nAnd talking turned to screams, oh\n\nDidn\u2019t they tell us, \"Don\u2019t rush into things\"?\nDidn't you flash your green eyes at me?\nDidn\u2019t you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?\nOoh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?\nI felt your arms twistin' around me\nIt\u2019s all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind\nBut darlin'\n\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it\nAnd we pretended it could last forever, eh\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it\nAnd life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh\n\nIn Wonderland, eh, eh\nIn Wonderland\nIn Wonderland, woah\nIn Wonderland\nI reached for you, but you were gone\nI knew I had to go back home\nYou searched the world for somethin' else\nTo make you feel like what we had\nAnd in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad\nOh\n\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it\nAnd we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever)\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)\nAnd life was never worse, but never better (Never better)\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)\nAnd we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)\nWe found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)\nAnd life

enough\nSmall talk, he drives, coffee at midnight\nThe light reflects the chain on your neck\nHe says, \"Look up\" and your shoulders brush\nNo proof, one touch, but you felt enough\n\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you\nYou can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you\nYou can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)\nYou are in love, true love, you are in lov\u0435\n\nMorning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday\nYou keep his shirt, he keeps his word\nAnd for once, you l\u0435t go of your fears and your ghosts\nOne step, not much, but it said enough\nYou kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk\nOne night, he wakes, strange look on his face\nPauses, then says, \"You're my best friend\"\nAnd you knew what it was, he is in love\nYou might also like\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you\nYou can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you\nYou can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)\nYou are in love, true love, you are in love\n\nAnd so it goes\nYou two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round\nAnd he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown\nAnd you understand now\nWhy they lost their minds and fought the wars\nAnd why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words\n\n'Cause you can hear it in the silence\nYou can feel it on the way home\nYou can see it with the lights out\nYou are in love, true love, you are in love\n\nYou can hear it in the silence

Legends (Taylor\u2019s Version)  Lyrics\nYou had people who called you on unmarked numbers\nIn my peripheral vision\nI let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer\nAll was quickly forgiven\nYou were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious\nFlush with the currency of cool\nI was always turnin' out my empty pockets\nAnd when it came to you\n\nI didn't come here to make friends\nWe were born to be suburban legends\nWhen you hold me, it holds me together\nAnd you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n\nI had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs\nWould surprise the whole school\nWhen I ended up back at our class reunion\nWalkin' in with you\nYou'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries\nWith the pages ripped out\nI am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium\nAnd I can still see you now\nYou might also like\nI didn't come here to make friends\nWe were born to be suburban legends\nWhen you hold me, it holds me together\nAnd you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\nI know that you still remember\nWe were born to be national treasures\nWhen you told me we'd get back together\nAnd you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n\nTick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block\nI broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\nWaves crash on the shore, I dash to the door\nYou don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined\nTick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block\nI broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\nWaves crash to the shore, I dash to the door\nYou don't knock anymore and I

My backup singers and bandmates gathered around me in a scattered circle. Scissors emerged and I watched in the mirror as my locks of long curly hair fell in piles on the floor. There I was in my plaid button down shirt, grinning sheepishly as my tour mates and friends cheered on my haircut. This simple thing that everyone does. But I had a secret. For me, it was more than a change of hairstyle. When I was 24, I decided to completly reinvent mys\u0435lf.\nHow does a person reinv\u0435nt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.\nYou see\u2014in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming\u2014the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.\nIt became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.\nBeing a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn\u2019t sensationalize or sexualize that\u2014right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.\nBut none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.\nThere was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of na\u00efvet\u00e9, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of na\u00efvet\u00e9, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.\nI'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in \"Blank Space\" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in \"Welcome To New York.\" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.\nI was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.\nThis moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.\nI present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.\nIt's been waiting for you.\nTaylor1Embed"}}]}
